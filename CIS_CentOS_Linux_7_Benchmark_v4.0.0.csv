1.1.2.1.1 Ensure /tmp is a separate partition (Automated)," Level 1 - Server 
 Level 1 - Workstation","The /tmp directory is a world-writable directory used for temporary storage by all users 
and some applications. 
-IF- an entry for /tmp exists in /etc/fstab it will take precedence over entries in 
systemd default unit file. 
Note: In an environment where the main system is diskless and connected to iSCSI, 
entries in /etc/fstab may not take precedence. 
/tmp can be configured to use tmpfs. 
tmpfs puts everything into the kernel internal caches and grows and shrinks to 
accommodate the files it contains and is able to swap unneeded pages out to swap 
space. It has maximum size limits which can be adjusted on the fly via mount -o 
remount. 
Since tmpfs lives completely in the page cache and on swap, all tmpfs pages will be 
shown as ""Shmem"" in /proc/meminfo and ""Shared"" in free. Notice that these counters 
also include shared memory. The most reliable way to get the count is using df and du. 
tmpfs has three mount options for sizing: 
• 
size: The limit of allocated bytes for this tmpfs instance. The default is half of 
your physical RAM without swap. If you oversize your tmpfs instances the 
machine will deadlock since the OOM handler will not be able to free that 
memory. 
• 
nr_blocks: The same as size, but in blocks of PAGE_SIZE. 
• 
nr_inodes: The maximum number of inodes for this instance. The default is half 
of the number of your physical RAM pages, or (on a machine with highmem) the 
number of lowmem RAM pages, whichever is the lower. 
These parameters accept a suffix k, m or g and can be changed on remount. The size 
parameter also accepts a suffix % to limit this tmpfs instance to that percentage of your 
physical RAM. The default, when neither size nor nr_blocks is specified, is size=50%.","Making /tmp its own file system allows an administrator to set additional mount options 
such as the noexec option on the mount, making /tmp useless for an attacker to install 
executable code. It would also prevent an attacker from establishing a hard link to a 
system setuid program and wait for it to be updated. Once the program was updated, 
the hard link would be broken, and the attacker would have his own copy of the 
program. If the program happened to have a security vulnerability, the attacker could 
continue to exploit the known flaw. 
This can be accomplished by either mounting tmpfs to /tmp, or creating a separate 
partition for /tmp. 
Impact: 
By design files saved to /tmp should have no expectation of surviving a reboot of the 
system. tmpfs is ram based and all files stored to tmpfs will be lost when the system is 
rebooted. 
If files need to be persistent through a reboot, they should be saved to /var/tmp not 
/tmp. 
Since the /tmp directory is intended to be world-writable, there is a risk of resource 
exhaustion if it is not bound to tmpfs or a separate partition. 
Running out of /tmp space is a problem regardless of what kind of filesystem lies under 
it, but in a configuration where /tmp is not a separate file system it will essentially have 
the whole disk available, as the default installation only creates a single / partition. On 
the other hand, a RAM-based /tmp (as with tmpfs) will almost certainly be much 
smaller, which can lead to applications filling up the filesystem much more easily. 
Another alternative is to create a dedicated partition for /tmp from a separate volume or 
disk. One of the downsides of a disk-based dedicated partition is that it will be slower 
than tmpfs which is RAM-based.","Run the following command and verify the output shows that /tmp is mounted. Particular 
requirements pertaining to mount options are covered in ensuing sections.

1.1.2.3.1 Ensure separate partition exists for /home (Automated)," Level 2 - Server 
 Level 2 - Workstation",The /home directory is used to support disk storage needs of local users.,"The reasoning for mounting /home on a separate partition is as follows. 
Protection from resource exhaustion 
The default installation only creates a single / partition. Since the /home directory 
contains user generated data, there is a risk of resource exhaustion. It will essentially 
have the whole disk available to fill up and impact the system as a whole. In addition, 
other operations on the system could fill up the disk unrelated to /home and impact all 
local users. 
Fine grained control over the mount 
Configuring /home as its own file system allows an administrator to set additional mount 
options such as noexec/nosuid/nodev. These options limit an attacker's ability to create 
exploits on the system. In the case of /home options such as usrquota/grpquota may be 
considered to limit the impact that users can have on each other with regards to disk 
resource exhaustion. Other options allow for specific behavior. See man mount for exact 
details regarding filesystem-independent and filesystem-specific options. 
Protection of user data 
As /home contains user data, care should be taken to ensure the security and integrity of 
the data and mount point. 
Impact: 
Resizing filesystems is a common activity in cloud-hosted servers. Separate filesystem 
partitions may prevent successful resizing, or may require the installation of additional

The grubby executable has full support for the grub2 bootloader on x86_64 systems 
using legacy BIOS or modern UEFI firmware and ppc64 and ppc64le hardware using 
OPAL or SLOF as firmware. 
Legacy s390 and the current s390x architectures and their zipl bootloader are fully 
supported. 
Support for yaboot has been deprecated as all ppc architecture hardware since the 
Power8 uses grub2 or petitboot which both use the grub2 configuration file format. 
Legacy bootloaders LILO, SILO, and ELILO are deprecated and no longer receiving 
active support in favor of previously mentioned bootloaders. 
The default bootloader target is primarily determined by the architecture for which 
grubby has been built. Each architecture has a preferred bootloader, and each 
bootloader has its own configuration file. If no bootloader is selected on the command 
line, grubby will use these default settings to search for an existing configuration. If no 
bootloader configuration file is found, grubby will use the default value for that 
architecture.",,

data between devices over short distances. It employs UHF radio waves in the ISM 
bands, from 2.402 GHz to 2.48 GHz. It is mainly used as an alternative to wire 
connections.","An attacker may be able to find a way to access or corrupt your data. One example of 
this type of activity is bluesnarfing, which refers to attackers using a Bluetooth 
connection to steal information off of your Bluetooth device. Also, viruses or other

you are infected, your data may be corrupted, compromised, stolen, or lost. 
Impact:

may be able to operate your computer with a wireless keyboard. Disabling Bluetooth will 
prevent these devices from connecting to the system.

order to be allowed to use this command. If the /etc/cron.allow file does not exist but 
the /etc/cron.deny file does exist, then you must not be listed in the /etc/cron.deny 
file in order to use this command. 
If neither of these files exists, then depending on site-dependent configuration 
parameters, only the super user will be allowed to use this command, or all users will be 
able to use this command. 
If both files exist then /etc/cron.allow takes precedence. Which means that 
/etc/cron.deny is not considered and your user must be listed in /etc/cron.allow in 
order to be able to use the crontab. 
Regardless of the existence of any of these files, the root administrative user is always 
allowed to setup a crontab. 
The files /etc/cron.allow and /etc/cron.deny, if they exist, must be either world-
readable, or readable by group crontab. If they are not, then cron will deny access to all 
users until the permissions are fixed. 
There is one file for each user's crontab under the /var/spool/cron/crontabs directory. 
Users are not allowed to edit the files under that directory directly to ensure that only 
users allowed by the system to run periodic tasks can add them, and only syntactically 
correct crontabs will be written there. This is enforced by having the directory writable 
only by the crontab group and configuring crontab command with the setgid bid set for 
that specific group. 
Note: 
• 
Even though a given user is not listed in cron.allow, cron jobs can still be run as 
that user 
• 
The files /etc/cron.allow and /etc/cron.deny, if they exist, only controls 
administrative access to the crontab command for scheduling and modifying cron 
jobs","On many systems, only the system administrator is authorized to schedule cron jobs. 
Using the cron.allow file to control who can run cron jobs enforces this policy. It is 
easier to manage an allow list than a deny list. In a deny list, you could potentially add a 
user ID to the system and forget to add it to the deny files.","-IF- cron is installed on the system:

 Level 1 - Workstation","at allows fairly complex time specifications, extending the POSIX.2 standard. It accepts 
times of the form HH:MM to run a job at a specific time of day. (If that time is already 
past, the next day is assumed.) You may also specify midnight, noon, or teatime (4pm) 
and you can have a time-of-day suffixed with AM or PM for running in the morning or 
the evening. You can also say what day the job will be run, by giving a date in the form 
month-name day with an optional year, or giving a date of the form MMDD[CC]YY, 
MM/DD/[CC]YY, DD.MM.[CC]YY or [CC]YY-MM-DD. The specification of a date must 
follow the specification of the time of day. You can also give times like now + count 
time-units, where the time-units can be minutes, hours, days, or weeks and you can tell 
at to run the job today by suffixing the time with today and to run the job tomorrow by 
suffixing the time with tomorrow. 
The /etc/at.allow and /etc/at.deny files determine which user can submit commands 
for later execution via at or batch. The format of the files is a list of usernames, one on 
each line. Whitespace is not permitted. If the file /etc/at.allow exists, only usernames 
mentioned in it are allowed to use at. If /etc/at.allow does not exist, /etc/at.deny is 
checked, every username not mentioned in it is then allowed to use at. An empty 
/etc/at.deny means that every user may use at. If neither file exists, only the superuser 
is allowed to use at.","On many systems, only the system administrator is authorized to schedule at jobs.

"4.2.7 Ensure sshd ClientAliveInterval and ClientAliveCountMax 
are configured (Automated)"," Level 1 - Server 
 Level 1 - Workstation","Note: To clarify, the two settings described below are only meant for idle connections 
from a protocol perspective and are not meant to check if the user is active or not. An 
idle user does not mean an idle connection. SSH does not and never had, intentionally, 
the capability to drop idle users. In SSH versions before 8.2p1 there was a bug that 
caused these values to behave in such a manner that they were abused to disconnect 
idle users. This bug has been resolved in 8.2p1 and thus it can no longer be abused 
disconnect idle users. 
The two options ClientAliveInterval and ClientAliveCountMax control the timeout of 
SSH sessions. Taken directly from man 5 sshd_config: 
• 
ClientAliveInterval Sets a timeout interval in seconds after which if no data 
has been received from the client, sshd(8) will send a message through the 
encrypted channel to request a response from the client. The default is 0, 
indicating that these messages will not be sent to the client. 
• 
ClientAliveCountMax Sets the number of client alive messages which may be 
sent without sshd(8) receiving any messages back from the client. If this 
threshold is reached while client alive messages are being sent, sshd will 
disconnect the client, terminating the session. It is important to note that the use 
of client alive messages is very different from TCPKeepAlive. The client alive 
messages are sent through the encrypted channel and therefore will not be 
spoofable. The TCP keepalive option en‐abled by TCPKeepAlive is spoofable. 
The client alive mechanism is valuable when the client or server depend on 
knowing when a connection has become unresponsive. The default value is 3. If 
ClientAliveInterval is set to 15, and ClientAliveCountMax is left at the default, 
unresponsive SSH clients will be disconnected after approximately 45 seconds. 
Setting a zero ClientAliveCountMax disables connection termination.","In order to prevent resource exhaustion, appropriate values should be set for both 
ClientAliveInterval and ClientAliveCountMax. Specifically, looking at the source 
code, ClientAliveCountMax must be greater than zero in order to utilize the ability of 
SSH to drop idle connections. If connections are allowed to stay open indefinitely, this 
can potentially be used as a DDOS attack or simple resource exhaustion could occur 
over unreliable networks.","Run the following commands and verify ClientAliveInterval is greater than zero:

options and may simplify restricted configurations. 
• 
X11Forwarding provides the ability to tunnel X11 traffic through the connection to 
enable remote graphic connections. 
• 
ssh-agent is a program to hold private keys used for public key authentication. 
Through use of environment variables the agent can be located and 
automatically used for authentication when logging in to other machines using 
ssh. 
• 
SSH port forwarding is a mechanism in SSH for tunneling application ports from 
the client to the server, or servers to clients. It can be used for adding encryption 
to legacy applications, going through firewalls, and some system administrators 
and IT professionals use it for opening backdoors into the internal network from 
their home machines.","Disable X11 forwarding unless there is an operational requirement to use X11 
applications directly. There is a small risk that the remote X11 servers of users who are 
logged in via SSH with X11 forwarding could be compromised by other users on the 
X11 server. Note that even if X11 forwarding is disabled, users can always install their 
own forwarders. 
anyone with root privilege on the the intermediate server can make free use of ssh-
agent to authenticate them to other servers 
Leaving port forwarding enabled can expose the organization to security risks and 
backdoors. SSH connections are protected with strong encryption. This makes their 
contents invisible to most deployed network monitoring and traffic filtering solutions. 
This invisibility carries considerable risk potential if it is used for malicious purposes 
such as data exfiltration. Cybercriminals or malware could exploit SSH to hide their 
unauthorized communications, or to exfiltrate stolen data from the target network.","Run the following command to verify DisableForwarding is set to yes:

It is primarily designed to be used from scripts which install new kernels and need to 
find information about the current boot environment.

Impact: 
Both the audit and remediation section of this recommendation will traverse all mounted 
file systems that is not mounted with either noexec or nosuid mount options. If there are 
large file systems without these mount options, such traversal will be significantly 
detrimental to the performance of the system. 
Before running either the audit or remediation section, inspect the output of the following 
command to determine exactly which file systems will be traversed: 
# findmnt -n -l -k -it $(awk '/nodev/ { print $2 }' /proc/filesystems | paste 
-sd,) | grep -Pv ""noexec|nosuid"" 
To exclude a particular file system due to adverse performance impacts, update the

6.1.14 Audit system file permissions (Manual)," Level 2 - Server 
 Level 2 - Workstation","The RPM Package Manager has a number of useful options. One of these, the -V for RPM 
option, can be used to verify that system packages are correctly installed. The -V option 
can be used to verify a particular package or to verify all system packages. If no output 
is returned, the package is installed correctly. The following table describes the meaning 
of output from the verify option: 
Code   Meaning 
S      File size differs. 
M      File mode differs (includes permissions and file type). 
5      digest (formerly MD5 sum) differs. 
D      Device file major/minor number mismatch. 
L      readLink(2) path mismatch. 
U      User ownership differs. 
G      Group ownership differs. 
T      The file time (mtime) differs. 
P      Capabilities differ. 
The rpm -qf command can be used to determine which package a particular file 
belongs to. For example, the following commands determines which package the 
/bin/bash file belongs to: 
# rpm -qf /bin/bash 
bash-4.4.19-2.fc28.x86_64 
To verify the settings for the package that controls the /bin/bash file, run the following: 
# rpm -V bash-4.4.19-2.fc28.x86_64 
.M.......    /bin/bash 
# rpm --verify bash 
??5?????? c /etc/bash.bashrc 
Note that you can feed the output of the rpm -qf command to the rpm -V command: 
# rpm -V `rpm -qf /etc/passwd`  
.M...... c /etc/passwd 
S.5....T c /etc/printcap 
The rpm -qi command can be used to display package information, including name, 
version, and description. Following example displays information for bash package:","It is important to confirm that packaged system files and directories are maintained with 
the permissions they were intended to have from the OS vendor.","Run the following command to review all installed packages. Note that this may be very 
time consuming and may be best scheduled via the cron utility. It is recommended that 
the output of this command be redirected to a file that can be reviewed later.

 Level 1 - Workstation","Local accounts can use shadowed passwords. With shadowed passwords, the 
passwords are saved in shadow password file, /etc/shadow, encrypted by a salted one-
way hash. Accounts with a shadowed password have an x in the second field in 
/etc/passwd.","The /etc/passwd file also contains information like user ID's and group ID's that are 
used by many system programs. Therefore, the /etc/passwd file must remain world 
readable. In spite of encoding the password with a randomly-generated one-way hash 
function, an attacker could still break the system if they got access to the /etc/passwd 
file. This can be mitigated by using shadowed passwords, thus moving the passwords in 
the /etc/passwd file to /etc/shadow. The /etc/shadow file is set so only root will be able 
to read and write. This helps mitigate the risk of an attacker gaining access to the 
encoded passwords with which to perform a dictionary attack.
